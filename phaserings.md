PhaseRings is a musical instrument for performing expressive music with touch gestures. Anyone can create a beautiful piece of music with our sound schemes and generative composition engine!

Each ring on the screen represents a different pitch, and you can tap and swirl on each ring to create combinations of long and short notes. The angle and size of your tap will change the timbre of the notes you create!

PhaseRings includes seven expressive "sound schemes" featuring percussive sounds like marimba and singing bowls as well as pure synth sounds like phase and string synthesis.

Three "compositions" of pitches are included in the app, but you can also create your own custom composition by choosing three base notes and scales, PhaseRings will do the rest, generating a series of great setups from the harmony you choose!
