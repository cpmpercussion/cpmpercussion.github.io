[The Nordlig Vinter app](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/nordlig-vinter/id631988721) plays computer generated soundscapes inspired by the landscape of Northern Sweden in winter.

This app is designed to work as the accompaniment for my suite of works for vibraphone and iOS devices, but it can be enjoyed by itself as well!

It’s free! Check it on the [iTunes store](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/nordlig-vinter/id631988721).

The app includes three soundscapes - “Ice Drum”, “Snow Bells” and “Clusters” as well as an adjustable reverb effect that processes audio from the device’s microphone.

Extra Feature: Core MIDI Support! 
You can use a MIDI accessory connected to your device to play the app’s bell sounds. I often use this app with my malletkat for a super lightweight improvisation setup!

This app was created using the [libpd](http://libpd.cc/) and [PGMidi](https://github.com/petegoodliffe/PGMidi) libraries.
