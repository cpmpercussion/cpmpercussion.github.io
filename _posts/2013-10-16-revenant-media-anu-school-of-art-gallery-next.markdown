I’m performing with Ensemble Metatone at a very exciting concert on Friday 25/10 at the ANU School of Art Gallery!

Revenant Media is a special event celebrating a pioneering piece of new-media artwork: Stanslaus Ostoja-Kotkowski’s _Theremin ‘75_.

Four theremins have been reconstructed from the event from original and new parts and Ensemble Metatone and I will use them to perform Prof. Larry Sitsky’s work _The Legions of Asmodeus_ commissioned for the ANU’s “Computer and Electronics in the Arts” in 1975.

Following the _Legion_, the Metatones and I will perform our iPad work _MetaLonsdale_ and Ben Swift will perform a new work for live-coded audiovisuals.

There’s going to be music and video at the gallery from 6pm-9pm - and it’s free. Be there!

Look out for more photos and videos as the theremins are assembled over the next week!
