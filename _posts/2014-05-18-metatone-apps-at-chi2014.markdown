At the end of April I presented my Metatone Apps at CHI2014 in Toronto, as well as delivering a short paper. We brought a mini Ensemble Metatone setup with us: 4 iPads, a passive mixer, splitters, headphones and a travel WiFi access point. With this little setup, our “customers” could have impromptu jams on the four iPads and explore the network features of the apps. It was pretty exhausting to present in the Interactivity exhibition space at every coffee break and lunchtime while also attending conference sessions, but we had lots of interested visitors and discussions about how we use the apps in performance and the future directions our work could take!

I’m looking forward to implementing some of these ideas and catching up with some of our new friends at CHI2015!
