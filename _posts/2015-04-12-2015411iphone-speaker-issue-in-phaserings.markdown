title: iPhone speaker issue in PhaseRings

Some users with iPhones have found that the sound output from PhaseRings end up coming out their iPhone ear speaker rather than the main speaker.

For the moment, a work around is to swipe up to access the AirPlay menu and select "iPhone Speaker" rather than "iPhone".

Thanks for trying out my app! Proper fix coming soon!
