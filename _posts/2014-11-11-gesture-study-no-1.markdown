_Gesture Study #1_ is an open-ended exploration of touch-screen gestures for an iPad ensemble of flexible size. The first notated iPad work written for _Ensemble Metatone_, it was premiered at the _You Are Here_ festival, Canberra in March 2014 with an expanded ensemble of seven players.

## Performance Notes:

  * Duration: 10′
  * Each bar should be repeated approximately 8 times (around 30”).
  * Each performer should choose their own number of repeats.
  * The notes give an idea of what should be performed in each bar and should be treated as approximate.
  * This piece is designed to be used with the PhaseRings app: [metatone.net/phaserings](http://metatone.net/phaserings)

## Pitches:

Approximate pitches are given around the three lines (high, middle, and low). You might like to advance setup at each rehearsal mark. If using, Metatone Classifier the setups should advance automatically in response to the different gestures.

## Dynamics:

For swirls, the speed of the swirling changes the dynamics. For taps, you can play more loudly with a broader touch point (try finger tips for quiet, flat fingers for loud). For more dynamic contrast, try using the iPad volume control.

## Gestures:

The iPad parts are written with three articulations to represent three touch-screen gestures. Staccato denotes a short tap, tenuto denotes a swipe for the duration of the note and a circle denotes a continuous swirling gesture. Where swirled notes coincide with tapped notes, one hand should swirl while the other hand taps.
