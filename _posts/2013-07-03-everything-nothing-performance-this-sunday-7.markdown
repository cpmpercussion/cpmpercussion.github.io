This sunday I’m performing a short concert as part of David Sequeira’s ENP25 exhibition opening at [Everything Nothing Projects](http://www.everythingnothingprojects.com/) at Lonsdale Street Traders in Braddon.

I’ll be performing a special program of music for Malletkat and iPad in the gallery space including Steve Reich’s _Electric Counterpoint_, my own _Nordlig Vinter_ solo suite, and a new improvised duo for iPad and percussion with Christina Hopgood inspired by the exhibition.

Be prepared for an all-encompassing soundworld paired with a unique perspective on colour and geometry! 

**Exhibition opening 4-6pm - Sunday 7 July 2013 **

**Performance from 6-6:40pm.**

Here’s some more information about the event:

In David Sequeira’s work, the application of the circle motif to a range of surfaces blurs the boundaries between individual works of art and the gallery space. Through this process, viewers are encouraged to consider that a response to art is not only a function of what they see, but also the ways in which they see it and engage with it.

In these works, geometry and colour are combined to immerse viewers such that their experience of art is a result of interactions with a number of elements and points of view within the gallery space. These interactions suggest connections between old and new; discarded and prized; beginning and end and past and present. Geometric motif is used to interrupt a singular dominant narrative, thereby encouraging alternative even contradictory readings.

_Everything Nothing Performance 6-pm Sunday 7 July (approximately 40 minutes duration)_

Charles Martin, specialist in percussion, computer music and interactive media performs Steve Reich’s Electric Counterpoint,and two of his own compositions, Nordlig Vinter, and Metatone No.2 for ipad and percussion. Metatone. No. 2 is an improvisation based on the exhibition ENP 25 David Sequeira.
