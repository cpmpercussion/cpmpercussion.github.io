In August 2013, Ensemble Metatone and I performed a short concert of our works for iPad and percussion developed over the previous four months. We played two improvised pieces, _MetaLonsdale_ for four iPads, and _MetaTravels_ for four iPads with percussion.

The concert was held in the ANU School of Musicâ€™s Band Room and we were able do a multitracked recording of the audio and video as well as capturing touch data from the iPads. The resulting animations and video give a unique point of view of the performance.

The concert was also an important chance for us to engage with a knowledgeable audience and discuss the issues involved in using touch instruments in live performance.

The video of both works is embedded below! Hope you enjoy them!
