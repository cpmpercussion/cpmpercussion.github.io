About Ensemble Metatone:





<blockquote>
  
> 
> Ensemble Metatone performs improvised and experimental music using iPad-based instruments and percussion. The group continually generates new ways of making music using computers integrated into percussion setups. Their networked musical techniques separate the performers sonically while drawing them together as an ensemble.
