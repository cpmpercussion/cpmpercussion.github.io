BirdsNest is an iPad-instrument recalling the forest sounds of a Northern Swedish summer. Tap and slide to make music with bird calls, percussion sounds, and field recordings and have fun with the built in “auto-play” and looping features.

Metatone Apps on a network will automatically find each other and keep their scales in sync to help perform great improvised music with an ensemble! Every time you press "sounds" or switch one of the functions on or off there's a chance that your action will be mirrored in the other iPads in the group!
