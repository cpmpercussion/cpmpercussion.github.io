Snow Music is a simple computer instrument created by Charles Martin and Ensemble Evolution for bringing the sound of snow and ice in Piteå into their performances.

Tap the snow to create the sound of footsteps, swipe to create the sounds of sliding in the snow.

Three switches control ongoing musical phrases: haunting bells, evolving cymbals and a snowy winter wind.

All sounds recorded in Piteå, Sweden in February 2012.
